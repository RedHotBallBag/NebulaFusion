# PyQt5 to PyQt6 Migration Analysis

## Key Import Changes

### Main Module Changes
- `PyQt5` → `PyQt6`
- `PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets` → `PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets` 
- `PyQt5.QtWebEngine` → `PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore`

### Specific Import Changes
- `from PyQt5.QtCore import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtCore import ...`
- `from PyQt5.QtWidgets import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import ...`
- `from PyQt5.QtGui import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtGui import ...`
- `from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets import ...`
- `from PyQt5.QtWebEngineCore import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore import ...`
- `from PyQt5.QtTest import ...` → `from PyQt6.QtTest import ...`

## API Changes

### Signal/Slot Connection Syntax
- PyQt5: `object.signal.connect(slot)`
- PyQt6: Same syntax, but stricter type checking

### QWebEngineProfile Changes
- `QWebEngineProfile.defaultProfile()` remains but some methods may have changed
- Cookie store access might need adjustment

### QWebEnginePage Changes
- Some methods might have been renamed or parameters changed
- JavaScript execution methods might have different signatures

### QAction Changes
- Constructor signature might have changed
- Some methods might have been renamed

### QUrl Changes
- API remains largely the same, but some methods might have been renamed

### QWebEngineSettings Changes
- Some enum values might have been renamed or moved to different classes

## Removed/Deprecated Features

- `QString` and `QVariant` are completely removed (though they were already deprecated in PyQt5)
- Some older Qt4-era compatibility methods might be removed
- Some widget-specific methods might have been renamed or parameters changed

## New Features in PyQt6

- Better type hinting support
- More consistent API
- New widgets and functionality that could be leveraged

## Migration Strategy

1. Update all imports first
2. Fix class and method names that have changed
3. Update signal/slot connections if needed
4. Address any parameter changes in method calls
5. Test each component after migration
6. Leverage new PyQt6 features where appropriate

## Components Requiring Special Attention

### WebEngine Components
- QWebEngineView
- QWebEnginePage
- QWebEngineProfile
- QWebEngineSettings
- QWebEngineCookieStore

### Core Browser Components
- Tab management
- Navigation controls
- Cookie handling
- Download management

### UI Components
- Toolbar and menu creation
- Context menus
- Dialog boxes

### Plugin System
- Signal/slot connections
- JavaScript execution
- DOM manipulation

### Theming System
- QSS (Qt Style Sheets) syntax might have changes
- Widget styling methods

## Testing Strategy

1. Test core browser functionality first
2. Test plugin system and API
3. Test theming system
4. Test unique features
5. Run the full test suite
