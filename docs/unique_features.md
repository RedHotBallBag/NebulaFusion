)

# Transformation callback
def transform_content(self, content, url):
    # Process content and return transformed version
    transformed = process_my_way(content)
    return transformed
```

## Time-Travel Browsing

Time-Travel Browsing allows you to navigate through historical versions of web pages, comparing changes over time or accessing content that has been removed.

### How It Works

```python
# Take a snapshot of the current page
snapshot = self.api.take_time_snapshot()

# Retrieve a specific snapshot
content = self.api.get_time_snapshot(snapshot_id)

# Compare snapshots
diff = self.api.compare_time_snapshots(snapshot_id1, snapshot_id2)

# Listen for snapshot events
def onTimeTravelSnapshot(self, snapshot_id, timestamp):
    # Handle snapshot creation
    pass
```

## Neural Interface Customization
